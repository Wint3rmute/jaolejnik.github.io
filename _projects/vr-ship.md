This is just a part of a bigger group project done for the Universal Design course at Lund
University in cooperation with Linnea Petzold, [Lisa Christiansson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisa-christiansson-7a4681174/) and [Yiyang Liu](https://github.com/Vincent-Liu87).
My biggest contribution was the VR simulation created in Unity using Oculus Integration
Package. All the environments and objects were modeled by me in Blender.

### About the project
The goal of the project was to come up with an inclusive way to convey safety information
during a cruise. Our idea was to create handrails that will inform passengers both in a
tactile and visual way of the evacuation route direction. Most of the emergency exit signs
are static and cannot be changed during those emergencies. We wanted to address that by
designing our handrail to be able to easily adapt and change depending on the situation on
the escape route, eg. if an adjacent corridor is on fire, we want to direct passengers to a
different, safer route.

### VR Simulation 
We imagined an inclusive environment where important information is distributed and
conveyed in a more diverse yet subtle manner. We wanted to present functionality of the
rails in the new environment in an easy and simple way for people to understand. Putting a
person inside an interactive simulation with a VR environment allowed us to do so. They’re
placed inside a ship’s corridor and experience what it is like to be in the middle of an
emergency situation on a ship equipped with our handrail prototype.
